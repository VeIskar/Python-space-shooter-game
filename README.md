# Python-space-shooter-game
Game project in python inspired by the "Space Invaders" game


This is my another game project. This one is inspired by the old aracade Shoot 'em up up games.
Almost all of the spaceships sprites have been done by me in GIMP. Backgorunds are a collage made of different free asset pxiel space backgrounds.

## Assets

**Spaceship Sprites**: Almost all of the spaceship sprites used in the game were designed by me using GIMP.

**Backgrounds**: The game's backgrounds are a collage assembled from various freely available pixel space backgrounds.I used some of the free backgrounds that could be found on https://wallhere.com/ such as: https://wallhere.com/en/wallpaper/106712

**Player Ship**: The main player ship is a retexture (with few additions done by me) of the free 8bit spaceship sprite from: https://www.nicepng.com/. I made several modifications and additions to ensure it fits into the game's overall aesthetic.

## Current Features

**Wave of Enemies**: enemies spawn and come in waves.

**Spaceship moveset**: you can fly the ship on the map in all the 4 directions using keyboard arrows.

**Player lives and GAME OVER screen**: player has limited amount of lives that decrease after enemies pass through the bottom border of the screen once it reaches 0 GAME OVER text will appear on screen and then close the game.
