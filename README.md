# Python-space-shooter-game

Game project in python inspired by the "Space Invaders" game

This is my another game project. This one is inspired by the old aracade Shoot 'em up up games. I took inspirations from some of the online Pygame courses while making this game.
Almost all of the spaceships sprites have been done by me in GIMP. Backgorunds are a collage made of different free asset pxiel space backgrounds.

## Assets

**Spaceships and projectiles Sprites**: Almost all of the spaceships sprites and projectiles used in the game were designed by me using GIMP.

**Backgrounds**: The game's backgrounds are a collage assembled from various freely available pixel space backgrounds.I used some of the free backgrounds that could be found on https://wallhere.com/ such as: https://wallhere.com/en/wallpaper/106712

**Player Ship**: The main player ship is a retexture (with few additions done by me) of the free 8bit spaceship sprite from: https://www.nicepng.com/. I made several modifications and additions to ensure it fits into the game's overall aesthetic.

## Current Features

**Wave of Enemies**: enemies spawn and come in waves.

**Spaceship moveset**: you can fly the ship on the map in all the 4 directions using keyboard arrows.

**Shooting mechanic**: player can shoot laser at the enemies, while enemies can shoot laser projectiles at player, getting hit too many times also means losing

**Main menu and simple options**: game has a simple main menu and option to pause the game using "P" on keyboard

**Score, level and lives labels**: players current level score and remaining lives are all displayed onto the screen

**Player lives and GAME OVER screen**: player has limited amount of lives that decrease after enemies pass through the bottom border of the screen once it reaches 0 GAME OVER text will appear on screen and then close the game.
